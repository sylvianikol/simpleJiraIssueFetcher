        <summary>Allow tags to be added using date of commit instead of current date</summary>

        <description>When adding a new tag Sourcetree uses the current date on that tag. The tag date is then used by the Github UI for ordering releases. If tags were not added chronologically, the releases are displayed out of sequence. &#13;
&#13;
This can be avoided by setting GIT_COMMITTER_DATE to the date of the commit before adding the tag. &#13;
&#13;
I suggest adding this as an option under the Advanced Options of the Tag dialog.</description>

        <description>After downloading and installing the 3.4.3 beta-1 release, I have the following issues:&#13;
 # At the end of the installation I got a message stating there is already an existing SSH key&#13;
 # When launching SourceTree, all of my tabs have been closed and there are no repos listed in the Local view. (I am guessing this is because it's a beta release and my 3.4.2 install is still intact. This is my first beta release test so I was not aware of this) so I browse to a local folder and select it.&#13;
 # Then I get a message stating LFS is being used and asking if it is OK to install the necessary files, to which I clicked Yes&#13;
 # Then I get a message that 'git lfs install' failed with code 2&#13;
 # Then the same dialog as in 3.4.2 indicating the LFS binary content has not been downloaded yet appeared again.&#13;
 # Items 3-5 happen every time I launch the beta release now.</description>

Intermittently you can see small windows appearing in middle of screen, they do constantly log into GitHub/GitLab.&#13;
&#13;
Couldn't these things happen under the hood and stay invisible for the end user?&#13;

        <summary>v3.8.8 - Local repository list freezes when scrolling is needed</summary>
        <key>SRCTREEWIN-13457</key>
        <url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-13457</url>
        <issue-type>N/A</issue-type>
        <priority>Low</priority>
        <description>If the repository list is large enough to require a scroll bar, it is very likely to freeze the sourcetree application window for a few seconds or indefinitely.&#13;
&#13;
Usually doesn't show up as "Not Responding", just a slightly higher CPU usage and unresponsive window. I then have to terminate the process and start it again, but with a large repository list it is almost guaranteed that my window will freeze within 5 seconds of opening the local repository list.&#13;
&#13;
Placing repos in folders helps to some extent, at this point I am not able to re-arrange the folders without freezing and simply resort to using the system file explorer or searching by the name directly without opening any folders.&#13;
&#13;
I check for updates for it says I am up-to-date. My version: 3.8.8.3848. Since it didn't show up in the list of versions I selected the closest one.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Steps:&#13;
- Add repositories until the scrollbar appears in the Local Repository list&#13;
- Scroll, select repos, open folders, for a few seconds (usually 5s)&#13;
- Window will start freezing</description>

        <description>Hello everyone,&#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
My company is reporting me multiple buffer overflow on my machine (4000 per day) created bt this tool:&#13;
&#13;
c:\users\&lt;username&gt;\appdata\local\atlassian\sourcetree\git_local\usr\bin\sh.exe&#13;
&#13;
This is considered a dangerous behaviour so we need to investigate.&#13;
&#13;
Does anyone has any idea about why ?&#13;

        <description>Since installing version 3.4.2 of Sourcetree for Windows, I am not able to create pull requests.&#13;
&#13;
My previous version of Sourcetree was 3.3.9, so I don't know where the problem started.&#13;
&#13;
I have tried uninstalling Sourcetree completely and reinstalling it, but the problem still persist.&#13;
&#13;
This is a problem similar to the one reported here https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-12482 but this time the workaround doesn't work any more.</description>

        <description>When delivering a resolution to a conflict there is no indication as to how the conflict was resolved.  Knowing how the conflict was resolved is pretty essential in whether or not the pull request should be approved or denied.&#13;

Checkout existing option was working fine for 2.5.5.&#13;

looks like version 3.3.9. is not storing already checkout history in 'checkout existing' tab.</comment-text>

        <summary>Can't create a pull request</summary>

        <description>I just installed *SourceTree* version *3.4.2* and find that I cannot create a pull request.&#13;
&#13;
In the previous version (not remembering which one I had installed) I could solve this with the recommendation indicated in [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Unable-to-Create-Pull-Request-Default-Browser-Empty/qaq-p/1213475].&#13;
&#13;
But this no longer works. To be able to do the pull request I must do a _push_ and generate it directly on the web, this does work. But if I try it from SourceTree, a dialog tells me that "You don't have any remotes wich have extended integration settings configured, blablabla ...".&#13;
&#13;
When trying a _push_, it is very likely that I need to refresh my OAuth token, which for some reason is lost for this operation only.&#13;
&#13;
As much as I update my credentials, do a refresh of the OAuth token, nothing works.&#13;
&#13;
I can do _fetch, pull, tag, commit_ but not a _pull request_. &#13;
&#13;
I think it is important to mention that my account in bitbucket is through google, that is, I have not created a user. Under this condition, to reproduce the behavior you just have to create a branch from Sourcetree in any repository and then try to create a pull request.&#13;
&#13;
The _*Remote*_ button on the toolbar never changes state, always showing the _exclamation point_ even though my credentials and token are correct and up to date.&#13;

On the other hand, Sourcetree version 3.4.2 here is marked as unrelease, but when going to the download page, 3.4.2 is the proposal.</comment-text>

        <description>Hi!&#13;
&#13;
I have this branch 'bugfixes/bug1' and "Bugfixes/bug2'. I clearly made a typo, one starts with an uppercase B and the other with a lowercase b.&#13;
&#13;
When I use those branches locally sourcetree puts them automatically in the same folder:&#13;
 * bugfixes&#13;
 ** bug1&#13;
 ** bug2&#13;
&#13;
This is no a bad thing in itself, it's actually a good thing. But when I try to push my commits to origin it tries to push them to 'bugfixes/bug2', that does not exist.&#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
It's like sourcetree uses the folder name to reconstruct the origin branch's name instead of the actual origin branch's name.&#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
The 'Affects Versions' field doesn't have the option but my version is 3.3.8.3848</description>

        <description>Hi. Using SourceTree (ST) v3.1.2 (but problem exists also in the latest version).&#13;
&#13;
ST insists handling a specific repo upon any attempt to clone any other repo.&#13;
&#13;
Imagine this: You ask to clone repo A and get in return repo Z; You ask to clone repo B and again repo Z is cloned (in this case, repo Z is called "su4_pom_emv_shared") .&#13;
&#13;
Actions done:&#13;
 * Uninstalled ST&#13;
 * Shift-del folder _Atlassian_ under c:\users\&lt;user&gt;&#13;
 * Shift-del folder _SourceTree_ under c:\users\&lt;user&gt;&#13;
 * Searched all over in the Registry for the problematic repo. Zero results&#13;
 * Searched all over in C: drive for suspicious files containing the name of the problematic repo. Zero results&#13;
 * Cleared _Temp_ folder of Windows&#13;
 * Created fresh set of SSH keys (just in case)&#13;
&#13;
 * Re-installed ST&#13;
 ** With and without Mercurial (same result)&#13;
 ** With and without keys (PuTTY / SSH) (same result)&#13;
&#13;
Now get this: As long as keep using ST without exiting the application, everything seems to be fine (i.e. capable to clone any repo plus even Branch, Merge, Push and Pull successfully). But once you *EXIT* the application and restart it - BOOM! it masses up (see enclosed images)&#13;
&#13;
I get the error-message _*fatal: refused to merge unrelated histories*_ for** _**_ no reason&#13;
&#13;
As a last resort I logged in Bitbucket and renamed the repo. Ever since everything got stuck.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover: $ git pull works fine; gitk (other git GUI) works fine&#13;
&#13;
Will appreciate to have any assistance to resolve this irritating problem.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you.&#13;

        <description>I recently updated to SourceTree 3.4.2 and now when I try to clone a branch by clicking on a "Checkout in Sourcetree" link from our Bitbucket server, SourceTree simply disappears.  I get the normal "URL Actions" window, and when I click *Checkout* (or even *Cancel*) the application simply closes: no error message and no crash dialog.  When I re-open Sourcetree, the new branch has not been checked out.  I've been working around this by checking out the branch from the "Remotes" node in the left hand pane.&#13;
&#13;
Is there any kind of log file that I could provide to help debug this problem?  I looked in C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\SourceTree and did not see anything.</description>

                <comment-text>I'm not sure the severity should be Minor as this bug could confuse a lot of developers on why they are needing to do a git lfs pull every time they start SourceTree. They potentially could waste many hours on tracking down an issue that isn't on their end but due to a bug in SourceTree.&#13;

I am making a simple custom action to push to Gerrit.&#13;
&#13;
$BRANCH is not replaced properly in parameter field if not preceded by a space.&#13;
&#13;
I need to have as a parameter to the git command:&#13;

push origin HEAD:refs/for/$BRANCH&#13;

        <description>I am unable to clone a repository with in SouceTree.  I am able to clone a repository via the command line successfully, but not able to do so in the SourceTree application.  Here is the command line that we use for a successful clone:&#13;
&#13;
git.exe clone [https://crhodes@bitbucket.org/nemours/lawson.git]&#13;
&#13;
In SourceTree I can see all of the repositories, but I can not able to clone them in the app.  Do you have any suggestions or thoughts on how this can be resolved.</description>

                <comment-text>Hi Apoorv,&#13;
&#13;
I am getting the following messaage when we try to clone a repository.&#13;
&#13;
Command: git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false --no-optional-locks ls-remote https://crhodes@bitbucket.org/nemours/lawson.git&#13;
Output: &#13;
Error: remote: Invalid username or password&#13;
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://bitbucket.org/nemours/lawson.git/'&#13;
&#13;
 I am using the correct username and password for my account.  So I do not understand why the cloning process is not allowing me to clone the repository in SourceTree.  </comment-text>

                <comment-text>Seems that your repo doesn't support basic authentication(id-pwd) and needs OAuth.&#13;
Go to Remote tab and add your Bitbucket account there. Then try to clone</comment-text>

        <description>My company asks us to add a line in our commit message when we pair with another developer on a commit. We use Pluralsight Flow to scan our commits and provide metrics on developer productivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. It would be nice if Sourcetree had a way to append this line to commit messages for me so I don't have to type it out. The format we use is listed below.&#13;

        <description>I just upgraded Sourcetree to the enterprise version 3.4.1 and when viewing Remote repositories it is not showing all the remote Bitbucket server repos I have access to. The new feature of the Project dropdown list seems to not be functioning correctly and is sometimes not showing any of the repositories that exist in a Project or it is showing repos that exist in other projects.&#13;
&#13;
For example I have selected the project AP from the dropdown.&#13;
!image-2021-01-19-12-41-13-234.png!&#13;
&#13;
However the list of repositories that is returned is completely random with none of the repos from the actual AP Bitbucket project being listed but repositories from other Bitbucket projects being listed, such as as repo call test_repo in the ALM project shows up.&#13;
&#13;
I am currently using Git for windows system version 2.29.2 and have tried with LibGit2 disabled and enabled an both produce the same issue.&#13;

        <description>When you choose to show all files in SourceTree, the icon for the "clean" folders and folders with pending changes (modified/untracked/etc.) is the same. Therefore, the user should expand the folders one by one manually to check if there is anything to add/commit there.&#13;
&#13;
The folders containing changes should have a slightly different icon so they are identified easily (similar to P4V).</description>

Waiting for more than a minute and still no response. &#13;

This happened to me with BeyondCompare, meld,  winmerge and I think I've attempted a few others as well. Not once did this issue happened to me with when I used Pycharm with Git and BeyondCompare. &#13;

&#13;

&#13;
Every time I click Yes, the pull appears to be successful, but I get the same prompt again next time I launch. This did not happen prior to v3.4.2.&#13;

        <description>Since installing version 3.4.2 of Sourcetree for Windows, I am not able to create pull requests.&#13;
&#13;
My previous version of Sourcetree was 3.3.9, so I don't know where the problem started.&#13;
&#13;
I have tried uninstalling Sourcetree completely and reinstalling it, but the problem still persist.&#13;
&#13;
This is a problem similar to the one reported here https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-12482 but this time the workaround doesn't work any more.</description>

        <description>Using git-svn for clone, fetch ect. does not work. I never tried this before, but according to Blogposts for Version 1.4 a while ago git-svn at least was supported.&#13;
&#13;
When I enter the URL, I'm asked for credentials and authentication works. After that Sourcetree tells me that it is no valid URL. Details show these error:&#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
{code:java}&#13;
Command: git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false --no-optional-locks ls-remote &lt;myrepo&gt;&#13;
Output:&#13;
Error: fatal: repository '&lt;myrepo&gt;' not found&#13;
Command: perl.exe &lt;SourceTree-InstallPath&gt;\tools\svn.pl info &lt;myrepo&gt;&#13;
Output:&#13;
Error: System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The system cannot find the specified file&#13;
{code}&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
Trying to install perl did not help and had no effect on these errors.&#13;
&#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
I performed the clone command on git bash and it worked. I could add the cloned repository to Sourcetree, performing a pull or fetch does not work. Sourcetree seems to hang on the authentication:&#13;
{code:java}&#13;
git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false --no-optional-locks svn fetch&#13;
Authentication realm: &lt;myrepo&gt; VisualSVN Server{code}</description>

                <comment-text>Ah, I forgot to mention that after performing the git-svn clone via git bash all operations seem to work with TortoiseGit. (First try to clone with tortoiseGit didn't work as well, because it did some steps (I later recognized these in the git bash output) and after a while it said "Work is done" but the folder was empty.)&#13;
&#13;
So there seems no problem with my git installation itself.</comment-text>

        <description>When I start Soucretree I am faced with a warning sign on the 'Remote'  icon. I click on it and I am faced with the error message "Unable to open your web browser to 'git@vcs.....', do you have a default web browser set?" &#13;
&#13;
I have tried the methods on the internet:&#13;
To click cance, go to settings, click the remote, don't change anything, click OK, then click OK again.&#13;
&#13;
The warning exclamation mark is still there. </description>
