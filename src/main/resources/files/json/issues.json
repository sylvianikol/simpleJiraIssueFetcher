Under this condition, to reproduce the behavior you just have to create a branch from Sourcetree in any repository and then try to create a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe _*Remote*_ button on the toolbar never changes state, always showing the _exclamation point_ even though my credentials and token are correct and up to date.\r\n\r\n ",

Zero results\r\n * Searched all over in C: drive for suspicious files containing the name of the problematic repo. Zero results\r\n * Cleared _Temp_ folder of Windows\r\n * Created fresh set of SSH keys (just in case)\r\n\r\n * Re-installed ST\r\n ** With and without Mercurial (same result)\r\n ** With and without keys (PuTTY / SSH) (same result)\r\n\r\nNow get this: As long as keep using ST without exiting the application, everything seems to be fine (i.e. capable to clone any repo plus even Branch, Merge, Push and Pull successfully). But once you *EXIT* the application and restart it - BOOM! it masses up (see enclosed images)\r\n\r\nI get the error-message _*fatal: refused to merge unrelated histories*_ for** _**_ no reason\r\n\r\nAs a last resort I logged in Bitbucket and renamed the repo.
