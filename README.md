# sJIF - Simple Jira Issue Fetcher

## What does sJIF do?
Obtains data from the [JIRA public server](https://jira.atlassian.com/) by a specific query using the Atlassian's [Jira REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-examples/) and persists it in both XML and JSON files. 
Written in a way that you can easily select the type of output (either XML or JSON) in generic manner.
